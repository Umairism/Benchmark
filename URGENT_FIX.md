```sql
-- Fix infinite recursion in RLS policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view user management info" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update user roles" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin users can view all profiles" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin users can update all profiles" ON users;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS is_admin();

-- Create simple, non-recursive policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" 
  ON users FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" 
  ON users FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id) WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 3. Refresh Your Application
